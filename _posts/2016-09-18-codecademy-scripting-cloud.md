I've spent a lot of my time as a Windows Server admin writing batch files and PowerShell scripts to help accomplish and automate basic tasks. Usually these scripts controlled something local on the server in relation to a service or the file system; I had never really branched out to writing code that leveraged API's or other external resources.

Fast forward to 2016 and I'm working in a primarily SaaS / PaaS / IaaS world and I'm finding the need daily to automate tasks using API's from different SaaS vendors and services. I've used PowerShell to write some of these scripts, but I've found that depending on what the script is doing or where it is going to live is becoming the deciding factor in the scripting language I use. For Azure Automation / O365 scripts I use PowerShell exclusively. For AWS Lambda I'm using JavaScript. For configuration management platforms I'm using YAML, Python, or Ruby.

Having never really coded anything with JavaScript, Python, or Ruby I had a lot to learn about syntax and flow control in order to accomplish the tasks I wanted to automate. One of the co-workers on my team suggested looking at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/all) and completing some of their courses. After completing the JavaScript course and starting on the Python course I've found myself very impressed with the courses and format.

If you understand coding concepts and are looking to diversify your skill-set by adding more languages I would highly recommend checking out their courses. Codecademy starts you out by explaining the basic syntax of the language and then having you type and repeat those examples eventually building up to loops, functions, methods, flow control, and other fundamentals. I found the pace to be rather refreshing as I could skip over things that I already knew and focus on the pieces that were different from the other languages.

If anyone knows of any other great resources for brushing up on their coding skills please feel free to leave a comment or mail me. I'm always looking to learn new things and open to looking at new platforms to do so.
