My name is Chris Neely and I currently work as a Sr. Systems Engineer in Oklahoma City, OK.  If you have any questions that this page does not answer please feel free to contact me.

I have worked in the information technology field for over a decade; beginning as support staff for a dial-up ISP, moving to desk-side support and eventually working up to supporting infrastructure platforms / systems.  During this progression I mostly worked to support and design on-premise infrastructure solutions.

My latest venture has been working with a team of talented individuals to move away from on-premise solutions to cloud-based solutions and it has been very refreshing and exciting.  One of my goals with this blog is to talk about the pitfalls we faced and the success we reaped.

I am married to my wife Katie and we have two wonderful healthy sons, James and William.  My interests are all things technology, making music, and occasionally gaming.
